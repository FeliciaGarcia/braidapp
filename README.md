This project is the start of a platform that allows users to share their braid styles and find someone
 to braid their hair. Within the global black diaspora, the art of cornrow and braid styles holds a lot of
 cultural significance. Not only does it add creative and aesthetic value, but it is among the many ways we 
  express love and care for our families and friends. I always thought that it would be awesome if there was a 
  way to bring this part of the community in a digital space and I'm excited to finally tackle this challenge. 
  
  The app was bootstrapped with Create-React-Native-App and I'm implementing Firebase to store the user's data. 
  The MVP is to allow users to share their styles, and find the contact information of other braiders. From there,
  I'll continue to build other features based on the feedback I get from friends. 
  
  Other packages include:
  
  react native elements
